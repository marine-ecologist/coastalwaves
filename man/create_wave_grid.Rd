\title{Create Wave Exposure Grid Polygons}
\usage{
create_wave_grid(line, waves, interval = 50, width = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{line}{An \code{sf} or \code{sfc} LINESTRING object representing the reef or shoreline boundary.}

\item{waves}{An \code{sf} object returned by \code{calculate_wave_exposure()} containing wave metrics at points.}

\item{interval}{Numeric. Spacing between sample points along the line (map units, e.g. meters).}

\item{width}{Numeric. Total buffer width around the line (map units, e.g. meters).}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} polygon grid with the wave metrics columns joined.
}
\description{
This function builds an unstructured grid of polygons along a reef/shoreline line,
joins wave exposure metrics to the polygons, and returns the grid ready for mapping.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Points are sampled along the input line at \code{interval} spacing.
\item A Voronoi tessellation is created from those points and clipped to a corridor \code{width} wide.
\item Each polygon is assigned wave metrics from the nearest sampled point.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
grid <- create_wave_grid(whitsundays_union, whitsundays_waves, interval = 50, width = 20)
}
